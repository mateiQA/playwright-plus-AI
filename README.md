## Architecture

### Page Object Model

Each page is a class with three layers: **locators** (getters), **actions** (async methods), and **assertions** (expect methods).

```typescript
export class InventoryPage {
  readonly page: Page;

  constructor(page: Page) {
    this.page = page;
  }

  // --- Locators as getters (static elements) ---
  get cartBadge(): Locator {
    return this.page.locator('[data-test="shopping-cart-badge"]');
  }

  // --- Actions (async methods) ---
  async addToCart(productName: string): Promise<void> {
    const item = this.page.locator('[data-test="inventory-item"]')
      .filter({ hasText: productName });
    await item.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to cart' }).click();
  }

  // --- Assertions ---
  async expectBadgeCount(count: number): Promise<void> {
    await expect(this.cartBadge).toHaveText(String(count));
  }
}
```

**Why getters for locators?** `page.locator()` returns a `Locator` object (no browser call) — the getter gives you full IDE autocomplete for `.fill()`, `.click()`, `.toBeVisible()` etc. When a method needs a parameter (e.g. which product), it uses a regular method instead since getters can't accept arguments.

### Container-Scoped Locators

Instead of building selectors from string manipulation (fragile), methods scope a role-based locator within a product's container:

```typescript
// Finds the "Add to cart" button inside the card that contains "Sauce Labs Backpack"
const item = this.page.locator('[data-test="inventory-item"]')
  .filter({ hasText: productName });
await item.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to cart' }).click();
```

This approach doesn't break when product names contain special characters like `()` or `.`.

### Custom Fixtures

Page objects are injected into tests via Playwright's fixture system. Fixtures are **lazy** — only instantiated when a test destructures them.

```typescript
// fixtures/pages.ts
export const test = base.extend<PageFixtures>({
  loginPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await use(new LoginPage(page));
  },
  inventoryPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await page.addInitScript(() => window.localStorage.clear());
    await use(new InventoryPage(page));
  },
  // ... 6 more page objects
});
```

The `inventoryPage` fixture clears localStorage on every navigation as a defensive measure for cart state isolation.

### Centralized Test Data

All product names, prices, user credentials, URLs, and error messages live in `utils/constants.ts`:

```typescript
import { PRODUCTS, USERS, ERROR_MESSAGES } from '../../../utils/constants';

await inventoryPage.addToCart(PRODUCTS.BACKPACK.name);
await productDetailPage.expectProductPrice(PRODUCTS.BACKPACK.price);
await loginPage.login(USERS.STANDARD.username, USERS.STANDARD.password);
```

No hardcoded strings in test files — if a product name or price changes, update one file.

---

## Multi-Project Configuration

The framework uses 5 Playwright projects to separate concerns:

| Project | Purpose | Auth |
|---------|---------|------|
| `setup` | Runs login once, saves session to `.auth/user.json` | Creates auth state |
| `e2e` | Main test suites (cart, checkout, catalog, navigation) | Reuses saved state |
| `auth` | Login, logout, validation tests | Fresh session (no saved state) |
| `problem-user` | Tests for `problem_user` account bugs | Logs in as problem_user |
| `api` | HTTP-level response/header/performance tests | No browser auth needed |

### Auth State Reuse

Login runs **once** in the `setup` project and saves browser state (cookies + localStorage). The `e2e` project loads this state via `storageState`, so tests start already authenticated — no login step per test.

```typescript
// tests/setup/auth.setup.ts
setup('authenticate as standard user', async ({ page }) => {
  const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
  await loginPage.goto();
  await loginPage.login(USERS.STANDARD.username, USERS.STANDARD.password);
  await page.waitForURL(URLS.INVENTORY);
  await page.context().storageState({ path: '.auth/user.json' });
});
```

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts — e2e project depends on setup
{
  name: 'e2e',
  use: { storageState: '.auth/user.json' },
  dependencies: ['setup'],
}
```

---

## Test Examples

### E2E Test (uses saved auth)

```typescript
import { test } from '../../../fixtures/pages';
import { PRODUCTS, TEST_DATA } from '../../../utils/constants';

test.describe('Checkout', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ inventoryPage }) => {
    await inventoryPage.goto(); // Already authenticated via storageState
  });

  test('Complete checkout successfully', async ({
    inventoryPage, cartPage, checkoutStepOnePage,
    checkoutStepTwoPage, checkoutCompletePage,
  }) => {
    await inventoryPage.addToCart(PRODUCTS.BACKPACK.name);
    await inventoryPage.goToCart();
    await cartPage.clickCheckout();
    await checkoutStepOnePage.fillInfo(
      TEST_DATA.CHECKOUT.FIRST_NAME,
      TEST_DATA.CHECKOUT.LAST_NAME,
      TEST_DATA.CHECKOUT.ZIP_CODE,
    );
    await checkoutStepOnePage.clickContinue();
    await checkoutStepTwoPage.clickFinish();
    await checkoutCompletePage.expectToBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Known Bug Documentation

Tests for `problem_user` use `test.fail()` to document known bugs — the test passes if the expected failure occurs, and fails if the bug gets fixed (alerting you to verify the fix):

```typescript
test('Problem user - add to cart inconsistency', async ({ inventoryPage }) => {
  test.fail(); // Known bug: button state doesn't update after remove
  await inventoryPage.addToCart(PRODUCTS.BACKPACK.name);
  await inventoryPage.removeFromCart(PRODUCTS.BACKPACK.name);
  await inventoryPage.expectBadgeCount(1); // Fails for problem_user
});
```

### API Tests

HTTP-level tests validate responses without browser rendering:

```typescript
test('Login page responds within 3 seconds', async ({ request }) => {
  const start = Date.now();
  const response = await request.get('https://www.saucedemo.com/');
  expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
  expect(Date.now() - start).toBeLessThan(3000);
});
```

---

## Playwright Tooling

### Test Generator

Use Playwright's codegen to scaffold new tests by recording browser interactions:

```bash
npx playwright codegen https://www.saucedemo.com
```

Records clicks, fills, and navigations as Playwright code — useful for quickly prototyping new test flows before refactoring into page objects.

### UI Mode

Interactive test runner with time-travel debugging, DOM snapshots, and network inspection:

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

### Trace Viewer

This framework has tracing enabled (`trace: 'on'` in config). After a test run, inspect traces with:

```bash
npx playwright show-trace test-results/<test-folder>/trace.zip
```

Shows a timeline of every action, screenshot at each step, network requests, and console logs.

### Test Report

```bash
# Allure report (configured in this project)
npm run test:report

# Built-in Playwright HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

## AI Agents (Claude Code + playwright-cli)

This project includes custom [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) agent configurations that use [`playwright-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playwright/cli) for AI-assisted test planning, generation, and healing. The CLI approach is ~4x more token-efficient than the MCP server approach (26.8K vs 114.5K tokens for the same browser task).

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install playwright-cli globally
npm i -g @playwright/cli@latest

# Set up browser and install Claude Code skills
playwright-cli install
playwright-cli install --skills
```

This creates `.claude/skills/playwright-cli/` with the skill definition and reference docs that agents use automatically.

| Agent | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `playwright-test-planner` | Explores the app in a real browser and creates a structured test plan | Starting from scratch, need to identify what to test |
| `playwright-test-generator-custom` | Generates tests following POM pattern, fixtures, and constants | Have a plan, need tests that match this project's architecture |
| `playwright-test-generator` | Default Playwright generator (one test per file, raw locators) | Quick prototyping without POM constraints |
| `playwright-test-healer` | Runs failing tests, debugs them, and fixes the code | Tests broke after app changes |

### Usage Examples

#### 1. Plan tests for a new feature

```bash
claude "Use the playwright-test-planner agent to create a test plan for the checkout flow"
```

The planner will:
- Open the app in a real browser
- Navigate through the checkout flow
- Identify all interactive elements and states
- Save a structured test plan to `specs/`

#### 2. Generate tests using the custom generator (POM-aware)

```bash
claude "Use the playwright-test-generator-custom agent to generate tests for cart management"
```

The custom generator will:
- Read existing page objects (`pages/*.ts`) and fixtures (`fixtures/pages.ts`)
- Read constants from `utils/constants.ts`
- Generate tests that import from `fixtures/pages`, use page object methods (no raw locators), group related tests in one file, and use `beforeEach` for shared setup

Example output:

```typescript
import { test } from '../../../fixtures/pages';
import { PRODUCTS } from '../../../utils/constants';

test.describe('Cart Management', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ inventoryPage }) => {
    await inventoryPage.goto();
  });

  test('Add single item to cart', async ({ inventoryPage }) => {
    await inventoryPage.addToCart(PRODUCTS.BACKPACK.name);
    await inventoryPage.expectBadgeCount(1);
  });

  test('Remove item from cart', async ({ inventoryPage }) => {
    await inventoryPage.addToCart(PRODUCTS.BACKPACK.name);
    await inventoryPage.removeFromCart(PRODUCTS.BACKPACK.name);
    await inventoryPage.expectBadgeNotVisible();
  });
});
```

#### 3. Heal failing tests

```bash
claude "Use the playwright-test-healer agent to fix failing tests"
```

The healer will:
- Run all tests and identify failures
- Open the browser with `playwright-cli` and reproduce the failure
- Take browser snapshots to understand the current page state
- Update selectors, assertions, or timing issues
- Re-run until tests pass (or mark as `test.fixme()` if the app has a genuine bug)

### Creating Your Own Custom Agent

Create a new file in `.claude/agents/` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-custom-agent
description: 'What this agent does'
tools: Glob, Grep, Read, LS, Write, Bash(playwright-cli:*)
model: sonnet
color: blue
---

Your agent instructions here...

You use `playwright-cli` to interact with the browser.
See `.claude/skills/playwright-cli/SKILL.md` for the full command reference.

# Before generating, read existing patterns:
1. Read('fixtures/pages.ts')
2. Read('utils/constants.ts')
3. Read('pages/LoginPage.ts')
```

See `.claude/docs/CUSTOM_AGENTS_GUIDE.md` for the full guide on agent configuration, documentation patterns, and validation rules.

---

## Adding New Tests

1. **Create a Page Object** in `pages/` — getters for locators, async methods for actions, `expect` methods for assertions
2. **Register it** in `fixtures/pages.ts` — add the type and fixture entry
3. **Write tests** in `tests/e2e/<feature>/` — import from `fixtures/pages`, use constants from `utils/constants.ts`
4. **Add constants** — new product data, URLs, or error messages go in `utils/constants.ts`

---
